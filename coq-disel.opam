synopsis: "Core framework files for Disel, a separation-style logic for compositional verification of distributed systems in Coq"
description: """
Disel is a framework for implementation and compositional verification of
distributed systems and their clients in Coq. In Disel, users implement
distributed systems using a domain specific language shallowly embedded in Coq
which provides both high-level programming constructs as well as low-level
communication primitives. Components of composite systems are specified in Disel
as protocols, which capture system-specific logic and disentangle system definitions
from implementation details.
